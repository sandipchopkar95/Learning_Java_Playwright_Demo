### Description:
---
This is a personal learning and experimental project aimed at exploring the capabilities of Playwright with Java for end-to-end browser automation. The project is not structured around any specific test automation framework (such as TestNG, JUnit, or Cucumber). Instead, it serves as a sandbox environment to experiment with Playwright APIs, browser contexts, selectors, and basic automation flows.
---
**Key characteristics of this project:**
---
- No formal framework structure — purely focused on understanding Playwright concepts.

- Scripts are written in a lightweight and straightforward manner.

- Designed to test and explore browser automation capabilities like navigation, element interaction, assertions, and context handling.

- Ideal for beginners or those transitioning to Playwright from other automation tools.

⚠️ Note: This is not intended for production or scalable automation use. It is strictly for hands-on learning and experimentation.
